# Iris Classification Project

This repository contains an R Markdown project that builds a machine learning model to classify Iris species based on their sepal and petal measurements. The project uses the classic Iris dataset and demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow from data exploration to model evaluation.

## Project Overview

In this project, I aimed to build a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to classify Iris species. The steps involved in the project are:
1. Load and explore the data.
2. Split the data into training and testing sets.
3. Train the SVM model.
4. Evaluate the model's performance.
5. Make predictions on new data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have R and RStudio installed on your machine. Additionally, you need to have the following R packages installed:
- `tidyverse`
- `caret`
- `e1071`

You can install these packages by running:
```r
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("caret")
install.packages("e1071")
